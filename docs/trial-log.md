# Trial log

The first full review round of Socrates v2, started 2026-10-05 on branch `socrates-v2` (last commit before the trial: `0ba5013`). The app runs with `pnpm socrates` on port 4200 and keeps its data in `~/.socrates-v2`.

Three kinds of entry: what was asked, what was changed, and what Socrates suggests unprompted.

## Asked

_Nothing yet._

## Changed

_Nothing yet._

## Suggested

Open since before the trial:

- **A stopped turn needs a way back.** When a turn ends at a safeguard (200 steps, 60 minutes or the token limit), the answer says so, but continuing means typing "continue". A **Continue** button under that answer would resume the same task. (The token limit itself was fixed in `0ba5013`: cached prompt tokens now count at a tenth, and the default is 20,000,000.)
- **A browser tool's screenshot folder asks for approval to read** under "My folders". Allow `read` in a folder an MCP server was configured to write to.
- **Relative paths in an MCP server resolve against Socrates' working directory**, which put a screenshot in the repository root during the gold eval. Say so in the MCP documentation and default the server's working directory to the project folder.
- **The first message can wait about 25 seconds on routing** with DeepSeek Flash as the router. The "Reading your message" line makes the wait visible; routing itself is slower than it needs to be.
