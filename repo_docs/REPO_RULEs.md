# Socrates Repo Rules

These rules are strict and non-negotiable. They exist to keep the codebase understandable as Socrates grows into a serious coding agent.

## 1. Keep Package Responsibilities Clear

Each package has one job.

```text
apps/web          -> user interface
apps/server       -> API and WebSocket transport
packages/core     -> agent runtime and orchestration
packages/workspace -> local file, shell, search, git, and patch operations
packages/providers -> model provider abstraction and adapters
packages/contracts -> shared schemas, event types, tool contracts
packages/shared   -> generic reusable utilities
```

Do not place logic in a package just because it is convenient. Put it where it belongs.

## 2. No Duplicate Implementations

There must never be three versions of the same helper scattered across the repo.

If logic is reused:

- Put domain logic in the domain package that owns it.
- Put cross-boundary schemas in `packages/contracts`.
- Put generic helpers in `packages/shared`.
- Import and reuse the existing function.

Before adding a new helper, search the repo for an existing one.

## 3. Contracts Live In One Place

All shared schemas, events, request types, response types, tool argument types, and approval payload types must live in `packages/contracts`.

This includes:

- WebSocket events.
- HTTP API payloads.
- Tool call schemas.
- Tool result schemas.
- Session schemas.
- Approval schemas.
- Error payload schemas.

Do not redefine event or payload shapes inside `apps/web`, `apps/server`, or `packages/core`.

## 4. WebSocket Events Must Be Typed

Every WebSocket event must have:

- A stable event name.
- A schema.
- A TypeScript type inferred from the schema.
- A single source of truth in `packages/contracts`.

No anonymous event objects should be manually constructed in random files.

Bad:

```ts
socket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "thing", value: "abc" }))
```

Good:

```ts
const event = AgentMessageDeltaEvent.parse({
  type: "agent.message.delta",
  sessionId,
  text,
})

socket.send(JSON.stringify(event))
```

## 5. The Frontend Must Not Own Agent Logic

`apps/web` renders state and sends user actions. It must not decide how the agent works.

Frontend code may:

- Display messages.
- Show tool calls.
- Render diffs.
- Capture voice input through approved browser APIs.
- Trigger read-aloud playback for assistant messages.
- Collect thumbs up/down feedback.
- Ask for approvals.
- Send approval decisions.
- Send cancellation requests.

Frontend code must not:

- Call model providers directly.
- Call transcription or text-to-speech providers directly unless the architecture explicitly chooses browser-native APIs and records that choice through contracts/events.
- Read or write local repo files directly.
- Run shell commands.
- Implement agent loops.
- Duplicate backend validation rules.

## 6. The Server Should Stay Thin

`apps/server` is transport glue. It should validate requests, manage connections, and call package APIs.

Server routes must not become a dumping ground for:

- Agent orchestration.
- Tool implementations.
- Provider-specific logic.
- Filesystem logic.
- Shell command logic.

If a route grows complex, move the logic into the correct package.

## 7. The Agent Core Must Be Provider-Agnostic

`packages/core` must never import OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, OpenRouter, LiteLLM, or Vercel AI SDK directly.

The core talks only to the internal model interface from `packages/providers`.

The correct shape is:

```text
packages/core -> ModelProvider interface -> provider adapter
```

Not:

```text
packages/core -> OpenAI SDK
packages/core -> Anthropic SDK
packages/core -> Vercel AI SDK
```

## 8. Workspace Operations Must Go Through `packages/workspace`

All local file, shell, search, git, and patch operations must go through `packages/workspace`.

Do not run ad hoc filesystem or shell logic from:

- `apps/web`
- `apps/server/routes`
- `packages/core/agent`
- random utility files

The agent-facing tool wrapper lives in `packages/core/tools`, but the implementation lives in `packages/workspace`.

## 9. Tools Need Schemas, Permissions, And Ownership

Every agent tool must define:

- Name.
- Description.
- Argument schema.
- Result schema.
- Permission behavior.
- Execution function.
- Owning package.

Tool definitions belong in `packages/core/tools`.

Tool implementation details belong in the package that owns the capability, usually `packages/workspace`.

## 10. Dangerous Actions Require Approval

The agent must request user approval before actions that can change the system or consume meaningful resources.

Approval is required for:

- File writes.
- Patch application.
- Package installation.
- Shell commands with side effects.
- Git commits.
- Git pushes.
- Deleting files.
- Moving files.
- Network operations that send workspace content to external services outside the selected model provider flow.

Read-only actions may be allowed automatically depending on policy.

Approval requests and decisions must use schemas from `packages/contracts`.

## 11. No Hidden Side Effects

Functions should make side effects obvious from their name and package.

Bad:

```ts
getProjectInfo() // silently runs git commands and writes cache files
```

Good:

```ts
readProjectInfo()
refreshProjectInfoCache()
```

Side effects must be explicit.

## 12. Prefer Small, Composable Functions

Reusable base functions should be small and organized by responsibility.

Avoid large files that mix:

- Validation.
- Business logic.
- IO.
- UI formatting.
- Provider translation.
- Persistence.

Split by responsibility before the file becomes difficult to reason about.

## 13. Errors Must Be Structured

Cross-boundary errors must use structured error payloads from `packages/contracts`.

Do not throw raw strings across package or WebSocket boundaries.

Errors should include:

- Stable code.
- Human-readable message.
- Optional details.
- Source package when useful.

## 14. Session State Must Be Explicit

Long-running agent work must be represented through explicit session/task state.

The system should be able to answer:

- What session is running?
- What message started it?
- What tools were called?
- What approvals were requested?
- What commands ran?
- What files changed?
- What failed?

No important agent state should exist only in memory if it is needed for recovery, display, or audit.

## 15. Streaming Is Event-Based

Streaming output must use typed events.

This applies to:

- Model deltas.
- Tool progress.
- Shell stdout.
- Shell stderr.
- Transcription progress.
- Read-aloud generation/playback status.
- Feedback creation or updates.
- Approval requests.
- Patch proposals.
- Task completion.

Do not invent separate streaming formats for each feature.

## 16. Voice, Audio, And Feedback Must Be Persisted

Voice input, read-aloud output, and message feedback must use shared contracts, typed events, and database records.

The required model is:

```text
voice input -> transcription -> normal user message
read aloud -> assistant message -> audio output record
feedback -> exact message, turn, or model call being rated
```

Do not hide these flows in frontend-only state.

Do not add large sets of nullable voice/audio/feedback columns to `messages`. Use dedicated tables linked back to messages, turns, model calls, artifacts, and errors.

## 17. Add New Providers Behind The Provider Interface

New model providers must be added as adapters in `packages/providers`.

They must not leak provider-specific response shapes into:

- `packages/core`
- `apps/server`
- `apps/web`

If a provider has unique capabilities, expose only the normalized subset first. Add extensions deliberately.

## 18. Keep Naming Stable And Boring

Use predictable names.

Examples:

```text
AgentRuntime
ToolRegistry
ModelProvider
Workspace
ApprovalStore
SessionStore
WebSocketEvent
```

Avoid clever names. The repo should be easy to navigate months later.

## 19. Search Before Adding

Before adding any new:

- Utility.
- Schema.
- Event type.
- Tool.
- Provider helper.
- Workspace operation.

Search the repo first.

Use `rg` or `rg --files` before creating new abstractions.

## 20. Documentation Must Track Architecture

If package responsibilities, event contracts, approval policy, or dependency direction changes, update `repo_docs/`.

Architecture docs are not decorative. They are working agreements.

## 21. The Default Bias Is Reuse

When implementing a feature, the default path is:

1. Find the existing contract.
2. Find the existing package owner.
3. Add the smallest missing reusable function there.
4. Import it where needed.
5. Avoid one-off local implementations.

If a one-off is unavoidable, leave a short comment explaining why it is intentionally not shared.
